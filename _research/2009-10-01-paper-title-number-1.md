In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics that are utilized in quantum computing and analyzed the mathematical problems underlying current encryption systems. We have demonstrated how quantum algorithms can easily compromise these encryption systems and discussed ways to build robust post-quantum cryptographic systems. Lastly, we have highlighted the critical applications of quantum computing and its future directions, emphasizing potential research areas that will help us address quantum threats in the future.
This book chapter is under review for the Springer Handbook of Data Engineering.
